      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        The American English expression "fried chicken" was first recorded in
        the 1830s, and frequently appears in American cookbooks of the 1860s and
        1870s. The origin of fried chicken in the southern states of America has
        been traced to precedents in Scottish and West African cuisine. Scottish
        fried chicken was cooked in fat, but unseasoned; while West African
        fried chicken was seasoned, but battered and cooked in palm oil.
        Scottish frying techniques and African seasoning techniques were used in
        the American South by enslaved Africans. <br />
        <br />
        Fried chicken provided some means of an independent economy for enslaved
        and segregated African-American women, who became noted sellers of
        poultry (live or cooked) as early as the 1730s. Because of the expensive
        nature of the ingredients, it was, despite popular belief, a rare dish
        in the African-American community reserved (as in Africa) for special
        occasions. When it was introduced to the American South, fried chicken
        became a common staple. Later, as the slave trade led to Africans being
        brought to work on southern plantations, the enslaved people who became
        cooks incorporated seasonings and spices that were absent in traditional
        Scottish cuisine, enriching the flavor. Since most enslaved people were
        unable to raise expensive meats, but were generally allowed to keep
        chickens, frying chicken on special occasions continued in the African
        American communities of the South, especially in the periods of
        segregation that closed off most restaurants to the black population.
        <br />
        <br />
        American-style fried chicken gradually passed into everyday use as a
        general Southern dish, especially after the abolition of slavery, and
        its popularity spread. Since fried chicken traveled well in hot weather
        before refrigeration was commonplace and industry growth reduced its
        cost, it gained further favor across the South. Fried chicken continues
        to be among this region's top choices for "Sunday dinner". Holidays such
        as Independence Day and other gatherings often feature this dish. During
        the 20th century, chain restaurants focused on fried chicken began the
        boom in the fast food industry. Brands such as Kentucky Fried Chicken,
        Popeyes, and Bojangles expanded in the United States and across the
        world.

      <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pour oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed pot with a lid. Do not fill the
          pot more than 1/2 full with oil. Heat oil over medium-high heat to 350
          degrees.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, cinnamon,
          ginger, nutmeg and cayenne. In another bowl, whisk the eggs with
          water.
        </li>
        <li>Set a rack on a baking sheet or tray.</li>
        <li>
          Working in batches, dip the chicken pieces into the egg mixture then
          into the flour. Shake off excess flour then fry the chicken in the oil
          until brown and crisp. A meat thermometer is helpful here, the chicken
          is done when the internal temperature of the chicken is 165 degrees F.
          Dark meat will take 10 to 15 minutes and white meat will take 8 to 10
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove chicken to the rack to drain and rest, sprinkle with salt and
          serve.
        </li>
      </ol>
